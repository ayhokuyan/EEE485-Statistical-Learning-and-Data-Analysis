# EEE485 Statistical Learning and Data Analysis
The project implementation for EEE485 course, Bilkent University.
### Music Genre Classification using Spotify API metrics
 - @emredonmez98
 - Used [Spotify Tracks DB](https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db) dataset.
 - Removed severely underrepresented classes, and shaved the samples sizes to make the equal in size and normalized data in preprocessing. 
 - Used different features of the data since we have used a dataset with both categorical and numerical features. 
 - The discussed techniques are **applied from scratch**, without using any ML/DL framework. 
 - Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook)
 -  Used techniques are
	- **kNN**
	- **Random Forest and** 
	- **Multilayered Perceptron (MLP) / Feed-Forward Neural Network**
		- Varying Number of layers and neurons
		- SGD, Momentum, Adam and AMSGrad Optimizers
		- Glorot and He Initializations
		- Cross Entropy and Mean Squared Error Losses
		- Sigmoid and ReLU activations 
	- **Repeated the experiments using PCA features and compared.**
